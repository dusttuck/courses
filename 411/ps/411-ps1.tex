For each of the following strings of symbols, state whether it is or is not a term. Use our syntactic convenience of writing $(Lx.A)$ without the outermost parentheses in $A$, but do not omit any other parentheses.

\problems
\problem{Examples}
$ (Lv.v'v) $
        \answer
        Term
        \endanswer

\problem{\gobble}
$ Lv.v'v $
        \answer
        Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{1}
$ (vv) $
        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{2}
$ (v'v)v $
        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{3}
$ (Lv.v) $
        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{4}
$ (Lv.v'v') $
        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{5}
$ (Lv.vv'v') $

        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\problem{6}
$ (Lv.v(v'v')) $
        \answer
        Term / Not a term
        \endanswer

\endproblems

In the following strings of symbols, identify the free variables by putting a @*@ in front of them (which makes them turn green). You can edit the terms in place; you don't need to copy them or anything.

\problems
\problem{Example}
$ (v(Lv.vv')) $

\negskip
\problem{Answer:\gobble}
$ (*v(Lv.v*v')) $

\problem{7}
$ (Lv'.v'v) $

\problem{8}
$ ((vv')(Lv.v'v)) $

\problem{9}
$ ((Lv.vv')v) $

\endproblems

Complete the following substitutions. I now omit outermost parentheses.

\problems
\problem{Example}
$ v(Lv.vv')[(v'v')/v] $

	\answer
	$ (v'v')(Lv.(v'v')v') $
	\endanswer

\problem{10}
$ v'v[v'/v] $

	\answer
	$ $
	\endanswer

\problem{11}
$ v'v[(Lv.vv)/v'] $

	\answer
	$ $
	\endanswer

\problem{12}
$ (v'v)(Lv'.v'v)[(Lv.vv)/v'] $

	\answer
	$ $
	\endanswer

\endproblems

$ b$-reduce the following terms until you cannot perform any more $ b$-conversions. You don't need to provide the intermediate steps, but I include them in the example for illustration.

\problems
\problem{Example}
$ (Lv'.(Lv.v'v)(v''v''))(v''') $

	\answer
	$ v'''(v''v''') $
	\endanswer

\bigskip
There are two chains of $ b$-conversions that can reach this term:\medskip
$ (*{Lv'.}(Lv.*v'v)(v''*v'))*{(v''')} $  \cvs  $ (Lv.*{v'''}v)(v''v''') $  \cvs  $ v'''(v''v''') $

$ (Lv'.(*{Lv.}v'*v)*{(v''v')})(v''') $  \cvs  $ (Lv'.v'*{(v''v')})(v''') $  \cvs  $ v'''(v''v''') $

\endproblems
\bye
